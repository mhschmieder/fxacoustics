# fxacousticstoolkit
JavaFX GUI controls for working with digital filters and analog plus digital audio as well as pure acoustics

This is the JavaFX GUI partner for the acousticstoolkit and likewise is split off from its fxphysicstoolkit counterpart as it is getting rather large on its own and will continue to grow.
