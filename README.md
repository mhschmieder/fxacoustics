# FxAcoustics

The FxAcoustics library is for JavaFX GUI controls related to working with digital filters and analog plus digital audio as well as pure acoustics

This is the JavaFX GUI partner for the jacoustics and likewise is split off from its fxjphysics counterpart as it is getting rather large on its own and will continue to grow.
