# fxacousticscontrols

The fxacousticscontrols library is for JavaFX GUI controls related to working with digital filters and analog plus digital audio as well as pure acoustics

This is the JavaFX GUI controls partner for the jacoustics library and likewise is split off from its fxphysicscontrols counterpart as it is getting rather large on its own and will continue to grow.
